- For this assignment, I made use of the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32RI0qUnTzQ&t=938s), to understand how to create items in a scrollable horizontal view
- Also, For the Drawer and AppBar widgets, I referenced snippets from the Practical Flutter book to suit my implementation requirements.
